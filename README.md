This project is a complete machine learning-powered customer churn prediction system built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. It predicts whether a bank customer is likely to leave (churn) based on demographic data, account activity, and customer feedback. The core model is a Random Forest classifier trained on a cleaned and balanced dataset using SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and StandardScaler for normalization. The `model.py` script performs full preprocessing, training, evaluation (including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report), and saves both the model and scaler for deployment. The `app.py` script runs a Flask web application with a form-based frontend (`index.html`) where users can input customer data. On submission, the model predicts churn and visualizes the normalized input features using a bar chart rendered in `result.html`. The web interface is simple and interpretable, making it suitable for demonstrating predictive analytics in real-world business contexts. The application takes 11 key inputs (e.g., Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, etc.), processes them, and provides an immediate churn prediction. The project showcases end-to-end capabilities from data preprocessing and model training to web deployment and visual feedback.
